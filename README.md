# SmartAgriculture

* This is a group project for EN2560 -  Internet of Things Design and Competition module in department of Electronic and Telecommunication Engineering.
* We have developed a smart watering system based on the data that are getting from sensors at the field and weather data from OpenWeatherMap API.
* After setting the technical environment, we are confuguring a dashboard using node-red for the farmer to observe the data like temperature, humidity, etc..
* The farmer can control the watering system via dashboard, via voice command or via a different app from anywhere without actually reaching the field.
* Project report, node-red codes and arduino codes are provided here.
